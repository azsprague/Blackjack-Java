# Blackjack

## Overview
Simple Blackjack game made in Java. I also made this one a while back (along with Hangman) but figured I would upload it anyways. Uses casino Backjack rules
(i.e. dealer hits if below 17, stays if equal to or above). The GUI is very minimal, using a flat background and basic card PNGs that I found online. There
is probably a lot that could be changed and optimized in the code, however the game still runs nonetheless.

## Invocation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java ./Driver  
  
No additional arguments are needed; a window should pop up with the game, allowing you to either play or exit. When the game is over, it prompts the
user to play again.

## Libraries
No external libraries are required for this game to run.

## Notes:
This was a project that I did just for fun; I know there's probably a good bit wrong with it, but it's not an important system (it's just meant for
entertainment).
